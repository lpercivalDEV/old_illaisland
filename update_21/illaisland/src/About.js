        illa island is an umbrella under which all my creative efforts exist. whether it's music, writings, events, or coding - all of them are part of illa island. no one is just one thing and I'm no exception - I code, I make art, and music, and create experiences for people to enjoy and make people think. things that represent my whole self and my culture.

        bienvenidos a illa island. go get lost.
